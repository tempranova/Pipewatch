# Pipewatch

Pipewatch is a resouce for mapping out (for now) Canadian development projects. Right now, we map out proposed projects, some pipelines, some spill history, and a few land defenders.

We are expanding this information.

An api with plenty of information is available at:

http://pipewatch.org/api/?post_type=proposed-projects
- Type of project, year of completion, source, coordinate

http://pipewatch.org/api/?post_type=spills
- Type, amount spilled, date, companies involved, legal, environmental, sources, coordinate

http://pipewatch.org/api/?post_type=updates

More coming soon.
