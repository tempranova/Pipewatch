The proposed mine would process 30,000 tons of ore per day over a mine life of 28 years. Red Chris Development Company Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary ofImperial Metals Corporation, has a 100% interest in the Red Chris claims and would operate the mine.</p><p>Red Chris is the most advanced mine proposal in the southern transboundary region. The proposed mine is located in theterritory of the Tahltan First Nation, in high value wildlife habitat, with a tailings storage area Ã¢â‚¬â€œ approximately 4 km long and 1.2 km wide Ã¢â‚¬â€œ located in fish bearing waters. Despite First Nations objections and a court challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, Red Chris received an Environmental Assessment Certificate and project construction permits.</p><p>The proposed Red Chris mine poses a high level of risk to water quality and fish habitat, and threatens to devastate wildlife habitat on Todagin Mountain, a sweeping high country plateau above the headwaters lake chain of the Iskut River. The plateau is home to the largest lambing herd of StoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sheep in the world, as well as wolves, grizzlies, caribou, black bears, wolverines, and golden eagles. </p><p>The wildlife habitat at the proposed mine site is contiguous with Todagin South Slope Park, which was designatedas a Class A provincial park in 2001 to protect the StoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sheep critical wintering and lambing habitat. Wolverine, fisher andgrizzly bear are blue-listed species in Todagin Park. Mountain goats are found on the precipitous slopes and cliffs, while lowerslopes provide high quality moose habitat. </p><p>The proposed mine would erode conservation gains made by the establishment of the park. Draining the south side of Todagin plateau is a Y-shaped valley containing Black Lake, Todagin Lake and Kluea Lake, a spawning ground for rainbow trout, which flows downstream into the Iskut River. Under the Fisheries Act of Canada, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal to putharmful substances into fish-bearing waters. </p><p>However, under Schedule Two of the mining effluent regulations, lakes can be redefined as Ã¢â‚¬Å“tailings impoundment areas.Ã¢â‚¬Âù Imperial Metals proposes to use Black Lake as a Tailings Impoundment Area, blocking 80% of the stream flow to Todagin and Kluea Lake, and creating long-term contamination concerns. Over the life of the mine, Red Chris could leave behind 183 million tons of toxic tailings and 307 million tons of waste rock, which would likely need to betreated for acid mine drainage in perpetuity.<br></p><p><br></p>",Published,proposed-project,,,,,,,,,,,57.73275168363678|-129.7986602783203,Mine,"Rivers Without Borders | http://riverswithoutborders.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Red-Chris-Briefing-2013-04.pdf,Imperial Metals | http://www.imperialmetals.com/s/RedChris.asp?ReportID=567393,",Site C Dam,"<p>The proposed Site C project is located in northeast British Columbia, seven kilometres southwest of Fort St. John.</p><p>Site C is a hydroelectric generating system proposed by BC Hydro that, if approved, will be built on the Peace River in northeastern BC.
